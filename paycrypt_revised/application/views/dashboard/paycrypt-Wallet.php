                                <p>You can easily add your Copay-hosted wallet to Paycrypt by restoring your wallet backup in the Paycrypt app.</p>
                                <p>If you have a wallet seed phrase, go to Add Wallet > Import Wallet > Wallet Recovery Phrase in the Paycrypt app and write down your 12-word Copay backup.</p>
                                <P>If you've backed up your wallet in a file or text block, go to Add Wallet > Import Wallet > File/Text Backup in the Paycrypt app and upload your Copay text or file backup.</P>
                                <P>Note that you will now be able to view the same wallet in both Copay and the Paycrypt app. Changes made to the wallet in one app will be reflected in the other.</P>
                                <P>If you have notifications enabled, be sure to disable them in one of your apps to avoid duplicate notifications. You can also delete a wallet from your Copay device (after you have imported it into Paycrypt) by going to Wallet Preferences > Advanced and selecting "Delete Wallet."</P>

                                <p>You do not need an account on Paycrypt.com to use your Paycrypt Wallet. Your Paycrypt Wallet is secured using your device and your private key: by design, Paycrypt never has access to your bitcoin or your wallet.</p>

                                <p>Have you backed up your Paycrypt Wallet? It's extremely important that you do so.</p>
                                <p>If you don't set up a backup and lose your wallet (hard drive failure, theft, etc.), then the funds inside will not be able to be recovered.</p>

                                <p>We have a guide on how to back up your wallet here in this help articles as well as a video guide. </p>

                                <p>You don't need a second device, you just need to copy down the recovery phrase and keep it somewhere safe. Please don't do anything like email it to yourself or keep a copy on the device where your Wallet is. If you do this and then your device is stolen, then the thief would be able to steal your wallet's funds as well.</p>
